You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join k8s-control-plane.lab.pwned.com:6443 --token yvxhex.k01ruoh1dqxpxhc3 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:1b2dbe4dd4c813fe187d8fdb557c2646c37d85fcf417f48e9baf63f0c9f1d147 \
    --experimental-control-plane --certificate-key 3b83e5d1dae6256e58a337b9675ba978047656d9d6be753592f6f43b99ef032d

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join k8s-control-plane.lab.pwned.com:6443 --token yvxhex.k01ruoh1dqxpxhc3 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:1b2dbe4dd4c813fe187d8fdb557c2646c37d85fcf417f48e9baf63f0c9f1d147
